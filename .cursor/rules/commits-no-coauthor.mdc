# Commit Messages: No Co-authored-by

When creating or suggesting git commits in this project:

- **Never** add `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>` (or any Cursor co-author line) to commit messages.
- Use only the subject line (and optional body) for the commit. Example: `git commit -m "Add feature X."`
- Do not append trailers like `Co-authored-by` to commit messages.

This keeps commit history attribution clean and avoids needing to rewrite history to remove these lines.
